I would like to dedicate this sample blog post to all **Kitties** everywhere who aspire to be more like foxes.

- **Kitties** don't have to work for their kibs and they eat lots of tuna.
- **Foxes** aren't lazy, they have to hunt and they eat miceys.

Hack up furballs leave buried treasure in the sandbox for the toddlers i hate cucumber pls dont throw it at me but love to play with owner's hair tie meow to be let in but cat milk copy park pee walk owner escape bored tired cage droppings sick vet vomit. Cough catching very fast laser pointer spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum. Always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose knock over christmas tree terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry so making bread on the bathrobe. Sit by the fire lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty so lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep but cough hairball, eat toilet paper so the cat was chasing the mouse so put butt in owner's face why dog in house? i'm the sole ruler of this home and its inhabitants smelly, stupid dogs, inferior furballs time for night-hunt, human freakout. Jump off balcony, onto stranger's head chew master's slippers yet catasstrophe hack. I'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! catty ipsum howl on top of tall thing yet sleep nap.

In Summary, Kitties can be more like foxes, but why?
