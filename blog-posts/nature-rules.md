I fucking love the trees and sky and ocean and rocks and rivers and lakes and all the critters that live.

But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Learn when to stop. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.

We'll put a happy little sky in here. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Just use the old one inch brush. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose.

I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. It's important to me that you're happy.

This painting comes right out of your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Play with the angles. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Let your imagination be your guide. A happy cloud. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there.

Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.
